{"name":"Trjtools","tagline":"Tools for Moving objects Trajectory Processing and  Analyzing","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis project is for moving objects trajectories processing and analyzing. It mainly consists of:\r\n* TrjTools: Tools for processing and analysing.\r\n* GISAppDemo: Demo apps for visulization which use Trjtools to do some analyzing works, e.g., Display Shape file using Sharpmap, demonstrate the trajectories...\r\n\r\nTrjTools mainly contains algorithms like map-matching, A-star, Indices like R-tree and Grid, Road Network data structure...\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project is created and maintained by @liyaguang.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
